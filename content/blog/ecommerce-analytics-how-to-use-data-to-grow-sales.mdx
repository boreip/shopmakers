Your customers have all the power. They are surrounded by reliable reviews from
their peers, they can quickly compare prices with those of your competitors, and
they can finally choose to buy or not from your ecommerce.

Your customers' expectations are always very high, but you have a potent tool to
meet them: analytics.

## What is ecommerce analytics?

Ecommerce analytics is the process of accumulating and interpreting data about
your ecommerce website to enable you to make wiser business decisions.

For example, with analytics, you can know where your customers come from, what
devices they explore your ecommerce with, and ultimately why they do or do not
choose to buy from your website. You can also measure your marketing retention
strategies to increase customer loyalty.

Ecommerce analytics include metrics related to the entire customer journey, from
when they discover your products to when they decide to take action and purchase
it.

## Why is analytics important for your ecommerce?

The more you know about your users' online habits and actions, the better you
can plan improvements to your e-commerce site.

Using analytics, you may discover that users find it frustrating to manage your
ecommerce's product filters and abandon the website. In this case, you might
decide to take action and ask the UI Designers to improve this part of the user
experience.

Or you may find that customers often forget products in their shopping cart, and
you can provide a feature that reminds them to complete their purchase.

Finally, you may learn that your customers think your website's search feature
is confusing. You could find it helpful to improve it and grow conversions!

These are clear examples of why collecting your users' data and using it to
improve your customer's experience is essential.

## Privacy matters

As we have seen so far, data collection is crucial to improving your ecommerce.
But this should not hurt your customers' right to privacy. Some analytics tools,
such as [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), can be (not always!)
very invasive and collect a lot of not unnecessary private data.

Aside from the ethical implication of invading your customers' privacy, in most
cases, these personal details pollute the data collected, making it more
challenging to analyse. Finally, consider that Google Analytics (and other
services) use cookies heavily. Showing a cookie banner is a legal requirement in
some countries, such as the European Union. A popup that prevents your customer
from reaching your products is [a truly awful
experience](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/29/business/dealbook/how-cookie-banners-backfired.html).

Luckily, there are many non-invasive alternatives to Google Analytics nowadays.
Most of them do not collect private customer data and do not require the use of
cookies such as [Matomo](https://matomo.org/), [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/)
or [Splitbee](https://splitbee.io/).

For our EU customers, we at shopmakers are big fans of
[Plausible.io](https://plausible.io/sites), a privacy-friendly alternative to
Google Analytics. How to setup Plausible on your Shopify ecommerce

## How to setup Plausible on your Shopify ecommerce

Let's go straight to the point and see how easy it is to add Plausible to your
Shopify ecommerce:

1. Create an account on Plausible.io.
1. Click on the `Online Store` in the left hand sidebar of your Shopify store
   dashboard and then choose `Themes`.
1. Click on the `Actions` button next to your current theme and choose the `Edit
   Code` option.
1. In the `Layout` section of the theme code editor select `theme.liquid`.
1. Paste your Plausible Analytics script tag before the closing `</head>` tag of
   the `theme.liquid` file and save it:
  ```html
    <script defer data-domain="yourdomain.com" src="https://plausible.io/js/script.js"></script>
  ```

Et voila, your ecommerce will track your customers' activity without the need to
spy on them or display ugly cookie banners!
